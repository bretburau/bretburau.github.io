	I guess you could say I've been programming since the 80's. My father brought home a used Commodore 64 that his office was getting rid of, along with a bunch of games. Eventually, I got tired of the same old games, and started digging through the boxes of disks. I found an introductory book on BASIC, and started playing around. I was able to build a program where you could enter the notes on a music scale, and it would play it on a loop. I found it fascinating that I could tell the computer what to do, and like children exposed to programming, I decided I wanted to make games. After messing around with a Zork-style text based game, I think the scope of it scared my 7ish-year-old brain away.

	Fast forward to the 90s and I had a Compaq 386 with 2 MB of memory and a 40 MB hard drive. I remember because It was a struggle to get early Windows (all 13 floppies) running on that system. I pretty much mastered configuring DOS, and started messing around in BASIC again. I begged my parents for a book on programming, and the got me one...only problem was that it was on Assembly. That's a pretty advanced jump for a middle-schooler to make, from BASIC to Assembly, and agagin I got scared away for a while.

	Fast forward again to the 2010s. I'd dabbled with learning some Python and Perl, just for fun, but never really got serious about it. I'd been studying engineering and bar-tending full-time to pay the bills. We decided to start a family, and was planning on continuing school, but quickly figured out that it’d be too much on top of the stress of small children. 

	After a particularly difficult day at work, I was researching around about job possibilities. I read about the increasing demand for software development and started looking into it. I'd always been interested, but seeing that a career could be possible without starting over in College was intriguing. So I began to take advantage of the ridiculous hours that come with having small kids and started studying code at all hours of the day.

	I’ve put in a lot of work, and I know there’s plenty ahead of me, but in the end I hope that I can use code to improve not just my life, but make things a little bit better for my family.
