This project was much easier to get started on, mostly becuase the backend was pretty much done. When I'd initially built out the all of the Rails stuff, there was always a feeling in the back of my head that these page refreshes are painfully slow.  I have the same thought any time I use a website thats a few years old and could use an update. I use a particular bank that's very guilty of this, and it drives me crazy waiting for the reloads. Even though its just a few seconds, on the modern web it seems like an eternity. 

I'd dabbled in jQuery AJAX prior to Flatiron School, but never on this scale and especially never on a backend that I built. Once I got the first 'index' type page working, it felt pretty spectacular. When the button was clicked, the display changed instantly, as it really should. Click handlers and event listeners are fairly new to me, and a pain to work with when you're learning. The motivation was there, though, and I googled and debugger'd my way through it to get them working.

I realize that jQuery isn't even close to all of the 'modern' frameworks. However the action involved in this project make it feel much more modern, much less 2008. I also understand that there are still zillions of sites and apps out there using jQuery, and its certainly worth knowing enough to be dangerous. Chances are at any job for the next ten years, something somewhere in the codebase will be using at least a little piece of jQuery. Its worth knowing how to work on it, fix it, and/or remove and modernize it.

I guess my biggest takeaway from building out this frontend is just how big of a difference this type of interface can make, vs. the older styles. I'm a couple more steps away from learning how to build the whole stack for a full-blown modern single page application, and thats pretty exciting. I'm also nearing the end of this program, which is really crazy to me, since this has been such a big portion of my life for months now. Can't wait to keep learning!
