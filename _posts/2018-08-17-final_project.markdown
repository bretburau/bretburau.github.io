Although it's taken longer than I thought, it still seems crazy to be submitting my React/Redux project. After almost exactly a year of getting up ridiculously early to code before my kids wake up, it feels pretty good that there no more curriculum ahead on the dropdown menu. I still have to pass the assessment and convince somebody to hire me, but here's my thoughs about the program:

I feel like I've learned a ton since I started this. I'd done some coding before, but never with such intensity.  I've always enjoyed learning, but I think this field brings it to a whole other level. Once the ball get rolling, though, it felt great. I'd actually gotten mad at points when I had to stop to go to work, etc. I really hope that translates well into actually coding full-time, because it seems much more rewarding that bartending.

That being said...I've got a lot more to learn still. The whole "you don't know what you don't know until you know it" thing really applies here, and I completely understand why imposter syndrome is so rampant. I've got a whole list of "things to learn after I graduate." Coding full-time would definatly help with the pace of learning, but I think the size of that list is always going to grow, no matter how much I can chip away at it. Thats the fun part though, things are never gonna go stagnant, as they eventually have in every job I've had before.

Coding is kinda weird. I actually kind of gave up explaining a bootcamp to people I know, as it's so confusing. People tend to glaze over when anything technical comes up, and the concept of a bootcamp is even more foreign.
