The nice thing about your first app built in a web framework is that you can actually show it to somebody, and while its not  exactly Amazon, it's a functional webapp. Previously I'd shown a few people the things I'd done on the command line, and the eyes instantly glaze over. Now, the glazing over at least takes a minute, but its a start.

The hardest thing, again, about this project is the blank slate. It took a couple of days to come up with an idea, have a basic plan worked out, and scaffold everything out. Then the 'where do I even start?' feelings kick in, and I'm staring at a blank VSCode file. 

Finally, I just decided to start writing migrations, worried that I'd be re-working the database over and over, but once I got going, momentum built and it got easier and easier. I got my database set up rather quickly, and started building out objects to work on top of it. Like I said, I was worried about my database being all wrong and redoing it over and over but really the only issue I had, other than modifying a couple of titles was having to add a joins table. Good problem to have, though it took some work to set it up and fix the object relations, I learned plenty...and that's the point.

Building out the controllers seems like a daunting task, but the more I worked on it the more it seemed like there was plenty of repetition. I'm assuming Rails is going to abstract away most of that, but it feels good to be able to look at a problem and think 'Oh yeah, I can handle that!' That normally means the next bug or issue isn't going to be so easy, but again, it's nice that some of them are getting easier to wrap my head around.

Once I had a good head of steam going, I was making really good progress but I realized I'd have to scale back from the original idea. My plan was to have recipes that would automatically generate grocery shopping lists, and factor in the costs, but that scale was just too big. I think realizing what I can accomplish in a set amount of time is important, too, I don't need to bite off too much, either on Learn.co or in real life.

I think the biggest thing I learned in this project (and this program in general) is that none of this is that scary. Once I got going, things just started clicking, and it seems like I can recognize more and more patterns on production websites I visit. It's like I can almost start to see the code working in the background when I'm on the internet. I don't have any plans on reverse engineering Google or anything, but maybe someday I can convince them to hire me!
