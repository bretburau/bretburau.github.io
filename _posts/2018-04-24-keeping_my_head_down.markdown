In my previous projects, getting started always seemed to be the most difficult part. Staring at a blank page, trying to figure out how to apply the things I’ve recently learned is a really tough thing to do. There can be an awful lot of “How do I even get started?” kind of thinking, and all sorts of second guessing to be done.

This time around, I intentionally forced myself to just start writing code as soon as I had a basic idea of what I wanted to do. I got an idea, I spent a little time outlining how the basic structure would work, and just picked somewhere to start and dove in. Things got started much faster this way, obviously. My database, my models, and basic functionality all came together very quickly. I thought it’d be done super quick, so I went a little bigger than I needed to. I scaled up my ambitions a bit from what was required.

Then the reality of the scope of things became clear to me. Rails is much bigger and much much bigger than just a vanilla Ruby CLI app. The most difficult part of finishing this, for me, was all the little details. Big picture stuff all seemed to click together for me just fine, but I kept stalling out on things like debugging Oauth logins vs. regular email logins, and making the model authentications work in both cases. I don’t know how many times I clicked an “Add to cart” button, only to have either nothing happen, or a brand new shopping cart get created every time. A few times I wanted to throw my laptop out the window, but I doubt that would help me finish.

This had been pretty much the complete opposite of previous projects, and it was actually much more difficult to finish this way. Previously, once the ball had gotten rolling, things seemed to go quickly. Now, due to the complexity of things, and somewhat due to how much I’d bitten off, it was like pushing a ball uphill the whole time. I ended up pretty much just having to push through, ready to move on to something else, but needed to close it out.

I think my biggest takeaway from this experience is just how complex everything on the web really is, even when it seems like it isn’t so bad from a few steps away. Rails is amazing in that it removes much of the tedium in building a backend, and really limits repetition, but it doesn’t do everything for you. There definatly needs to be a balance between planning out a project and just getting my hands in the code. Without some sort of outline, a lot of little things can constantly crop up and bog down the process. Conversly, spending to much time trying to figure out what toAlso, the concept of a minimum viable product seems more realistic to me now, just bang out something that works, and add to it later, its easier than trying to do everything at the same time.
