So I've begun to learn Vuejs. As my frontend framework experience is really only limited to ReactJS, and I guess you could include jQuery, though that's not really a framework. I have however played with several different backend frameworks, and I am starting to notice some patterns...at the end of the day any framework/library/whatever are all trying to do the same thing. Even though they might be different implimentation, different language, different setup, when I take a step back, there's always some similarities. It becomes clear where one group borrowed from another, or from two different places.
Anything in JavaScript right now is clearly going to be held up to React, and probably also Angular. I've never really worked with Angular, but I'm at least semi-familiar with the syntax and what it is. As I've said I've played with React plenty, and I can see where Vue has borrowed from these two systems. While JSX takes a little bit of getting used to, once you get your head around it, its pretty much second nature. The few minor differences between it and normal HTML start to make sense pretty quickly, and it feels like just writing a normal html template.
The first major difference I've noticed, which I believe comes from the Angular world, is how much the HTML properties are used vs. React. There's an aweful lot of ```v-``` properties being used to interpolate, amoung other different properties. With the little bit of work I've done in it so far, that seems like the first road bump for me.
As far as Vue components are concerned, I've barely scratched the surface so far, but it all seems fairly familiar, from a React-based perspective. The syntax is a little different, but as a basic idea it's all pretty easy to wrap my head around. There's similar baked-in methods, and passing properties around is again familiar. I'm sure the more I dig in the more differences I'll find, but for now I can just see the slightly different approaches to making development a little easier.
Though I've only really scratched the surface, I can see how and why Vue has been gaining popularity. A lot of the familiar pieces that are clearly borrowed from React-land make sense to me, and the new concepts seem to fit in pretty well. I look forward to digging in deeper!
